The workflow includes text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and training a simple neural network using TensorFlow. The model is evaluated using a train/validation/test split, and performance is assessed through accuracy metrics. All steps are documented with a focus on thought process and observations, in line with assignment requirements."

There were four ladies sharing a room (recipe for distaster right) But the room had different areas such as a makeup area and a separate mirror near the bathroom.

Other than that, this place was a real gem.\",\n          \"My new husband and I stayed at this hotel -th November for -nights. I booked this hotel (direct) based on the very reasonable room rate for NYC and excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived by yellow cab and were greeted by such lovely and welcoming staff. I had advised upon booking (almost a year before departing) that it would be our honey moon. They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all. I really loved the feeling of this boutique style hotel and loved the fact that it is a bit of an undiscovered gem. I will always recommend this hotel for NYC.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.\",\n          \"My girlfriends and I stayed here to celebrate our --th birthdays.

We stayed - nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over $----. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\\r\\nThe rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\\r\\nI did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\\r\\nNeedless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at.

The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\r\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\r\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\r\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location.

        "\n",
        "My overall goal was to build a sentiment analysis model that could classify hotel reviews as either \"happy\" or \"not happy.\" I knew that working with raw text requires multiple transformation steps before the data is ready for modeling, so I started by focusing on text normalization. Originally, I planned to include lemmatization, but after encountering persistent compatibility issues with Colab, I decided to turn it off. This was a trade-off — I lost a small amount of precision in text preprocessing, but it allowed the workflow to continue smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it came to splitting the data, I wanted to ensure fairness and consistency, so I used stratified sampling to preserve the label distribution across train, validation, and test sets. I made sure to fit the TF-IDF vectorizer only on the training set to prevent data leakage — something I’ve learned can quietly skew results if not handled correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "For model training, I intentionally followed the assignment’s instruction to use `TOTAL_STEPS = 100` and `STEP_SIZE = 10`. I knew this would drastically reduce the amount of data the model saw during training, so I lowered my expectations accordingly. What surprised me was how well the model still performed — hitting a **final test accuracy of 75.63%**. I observed that the validation accuracy gradually increased and peaked toward the end, which suggests that the model was still learning and hadn’t yet overfit, despite the small training size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this assignment helped me practice balancing technical goals with practical limitations. I made several intentional decisions along the way — skipping lemmatization, using small batches, limiting steps — and still ended up with a model that generalized well. If I were to continue improving it, I’d look into using word embeddings instead of TF-IDF and training across full epochs with early stopping.\n"
